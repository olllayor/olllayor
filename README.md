# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

- 👋 Hey there, I’m [@olllayor](https://github.com/olllayor) — a software engineer who loves solving problems without turning everything into a buzzword salad.

---

## About Me
I’m a **Software Engineer** who enjoys getting my hands dirty with code (and occasionally blowing things up in a controlled, containerized environment). With a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Turin Polytechnic University in Tashkent, I’ve dabbled in everything from tinkering with microcontrollers to building chat-based classrooms on Telegram. My philosophy? Keep it practical, keep it real—and always leave room for a bit of fun.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, JS/TS
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Django, Flask, NestJS
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Tools & Technologies:** Git, Docker, APIs
- **Specialties:**  
  - **Containerization:** Turning multi-service nightmares into a one-liner `docker-compose up`.  
  - **Telegram Bots:** If you’ve ever wanted to take an exam inside a chat window—or just get movie suggestions—you’ve come to the right place.  
  - **Web Apps:** Building RESTful APIs and admin dashboards without losing my sanity.

## Projects

### [Porla — Telegram Learning Management System](https://t.me/porlabot)
> **Tech:** Python · PostgreSQL · Aiogram · Django · Telegram Bot API  
> Imagine a classroom in your chat window—no desks, no chalkboards, just quizzes, webinars, and a bot that gently reminds you to study.  
> - Over 250 students use it daily for interactive courses, quizzes, and real-time feedback.  
> - Mentor dashboards let educators track who’s actually paying attention (or just procrastinating).  
> - Progress bars, live analytics, and enough charts to keep a data nerd happy.

### [Personal Website](https://ollayor.uz)
> **Tech:** Python · Flask · PostgreSQL · HTML · CSS · Tailwind CSS  
> This is where I show off code that (mostly) works and blog posts that (hopefully) make sense.  
> - Built from scratch with Flask, styled with Tailwind—because I like writing my own CSS until I decide I hate it.  
> - Integrated CMS for smooth content updates, so I only have to fuss with it once a month.  
> - “Live Demo” section to click around instead of reading dry documentation.

### [AIMerge](https://github.com/olllayor/aimerge)
> **Tech:** Python · Git · Gemini API · Argparse  
> A CLI tool that tries to fix your merge conflicts—so you don’t have to spend an hour staring at `<<<<<<< HEAD` and crying.  
> - Feeds your merge conflicts to the Gemini API for context-aware suggestions.  
> - One command, fewer headaches, and maybe a few “Did it really fix everything?” moments.  
> - Integrates into your usual Git workflow; if it fails, at least you tried something smarter than `git merge --abort`.

## Experience

- **Bot & Automation Development**  
  Built Telegram bots that scrape movie data, manage quizzes, and send notifications—so you don’t have to manually ping your users at 3 AM. Aiogram is my sidekick here.

- **Web Application Development**  
  Designed and deployed RESTful services with Django, Flask, and FastAPI. Learned that “just one more feature” can turn into “I should’ve done this in three smaller PRs.”

## Education

**B.Sc. in Computer Engineering**  
*Turin Polytechnic University in Tashkent* (2022 – 2024)

## Fun Facts (Because Why Not?)

- I once bricked a development board by forgetting to set the right voltage — lesson learned: RTFM.  
- I’ve written more Dockerfiles than I can count (and I still tweak them at 2 AM).  
- Coffee is my fuel, but I’m on a quest to see if tea can keep me just as awake. Spoiler: it’s a long journey.

## Let’s Build Something Real
If you’re into practical projects, sane code reviews, or just a good chat about software (or coffee vs. tea), feel free to ping me. I’m here to learn, share, and maybe make the occasional cat meme. 🐱
